title: Ruomin Huang
---
I am Ruomin Huang (**黄若民** in Chinese), a 2nd-year CS Ph.D. student at Duke University. I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Rong Ge][0]. Previously I received M.S. in Data Science and B.S. in Computational Mathematics from [USTC][1], where I worked with Prof. [Hu Ding][2].


## Research
Previously I worked on the algorithmic aspect of ML. Now I am interested in ~~mechanisms~~ physics of transformers.
